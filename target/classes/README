This project is about auctions in which people can put items up for sale, and others
can bid to buy them.

Input
A pipe-delimited input text file representing the started auctions, and bids.The file will be strictly in-order of timestamp.
There are three types of rows found in this file:

1.Users listing items for sale.
This appears in the format:

timestamp|user_id|action|item|reserve_price|close_time

timestamp will be an integer representing a unix epoch time and is the auction start time
user_id is an integer user id
action will be the string "SELL"
item is a unique string code for that item.
reserve_price is a decimal representing the item reserve price in the site's local currency.
close_time will be an integer representing a unix epoch time

2.Bids on items
This will appear in the format:

timestamp|user_id|action|item|bid_amount

timestamp will be an integer representing a unix epoch time and is the time of the bid
user_id is an integer user id
action will be the string "BID"
item is a unique string code for that item.
bid_amount is a decimal representing a bid in the auction site's local currency.

3.Heartbeat messages
These messages may appear periodically in the input to ensure that auctions can be closed
in the absence of bids, they take the format:

timestamp

timestamp will be an integer representing a unix epoch time.

Output
The program produce the following output as a text file in which each line represents the outcome of a completed auction. 
File's name consists of input file name followed by the word "Results".

Output file is delimited with the following format:

close_time|item|user_id|status|price_paid|total_bid_count|highest_bid|lowest_bid

close_time should be a unix epoch of the time the auction finished
item is the unique string item code.
user_id is the integer id of the winning user, or blank if the item did not sell.
status should contain either "SOLD" or "UNSOLD" depending on the auction outcome.
price_paid should be the price paid by the auction winner (0.00 if the item is UNSOLD), as a
number to two decimal places
total_bid_count should be the number of valid bids received for the item.
highest_bid the highest bid received for the item as a number to two decimal places
lowest_bid the lowest bid placed on the item as a number to two decimal places
